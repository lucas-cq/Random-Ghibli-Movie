## The Process
This was a fun project. My first challenge was finding an API that I liked and that fit all the requirements. My second challenge was making the code random. I decided to make it an [Array](https://github.com/lucas-cq/cpnt262-a3/commit/8e13f07ce92bfa5496be964c82df79f8062d20b0) but realised that was not streamlined at all. Luckily Jessica showed me an easier way that she learned from Fesal.

## Attributions
